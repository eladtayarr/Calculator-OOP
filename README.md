# Project Title: Graphical Calculator with Advanced Features
## Overview:
I developed a graphical calculator application using Python and the Tkinter library, integrating advanced features such as real-time expression evaluation, support for trigonometric functions, and Hebrew date retrieval from an external API. This project showcases my proficiency in Python programming, GUI development, and API integration.

## Key Features:
Real-time Expression Evaluation: The calculator evaluates expressions as they are entered, providing instant feedback to users.
Trigonometric Functions: It supports trigonometric operations such as sine, cosine, and tangent, enhancing its utility for mathematical calculations.
Hebrew Date Display: A feature to retrieve and display the current Hebrew date alongside the Gregorian date, leveraging the Hebcal API for accurate date conversion.

## Technologies Used:
Python: Leveraged Python's versatility and simplicity for implementing the calculator's backend logic.
Tkinter: Utilized the Tkinter library for building the graphical user interface, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and ease of use.
Hebcal API: Integrated the Hebcal API to fetch and display the current Hebrew date, enhancing the calculator's functionality.

## Code Structure:
MainApp: Serves as the entry point of the application, initializing the main Tkinter window and creating instances of various components.
CalculatorLogic: Manages the core logic for arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, and date retrieval.
CalculatorGUI: Implements the graphical user interface, including expression input fields, result display, and buttons for numerical and functional input.
DateButton: Provides functionality to display the current date and Hebrew date when clicked, enhancing user experience.
TrigonometryLogic: Extends the calculator's functionality to support trigonometric operations, showcasing advanced mathematical capabilities.

## Achievements:
Real-time Evaluation: Implemented an efficient algorithm for real-time expression evaluation, ensuring smooth performance even with complex calculations.
API Integration: Successfully integrated the Hebcal API to retrieve and display the Hebrew date, demonstrating proficiency in working with external data sources.
Error Handling: Implemented robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle invalid inputs and prevent application crashes.

## Challenges and Solutions:
API Rate Limits: Overcame API rate limits by implementing caching mechanisms to store previously retrieved dates, reducing the number of API calls and improving application performance.
Complex GUI Layout: Addressed challenges in designing an intuitive and user-friendly GUI layout by conducting usability tests and incorporating user feedback into the design process.

## Future Enhancements:
Scientific Mode: Introduce a scientific mode with additional mathematical functions and constants, catering to users with more advanced calculation needs.
User Customization: Allow users to customize the calculator interface, including themes, font sizes, and button layouts, to enhance personalization and user satisfaction.

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates my proficiency in Python programming, GUI development, and API integration, showcasing my ability to create user-friendly applications with advanced functionality. Through effective problem-solving and innovative design, I have created a versatile calculator application that meets the needs of both casual and advanced users.
